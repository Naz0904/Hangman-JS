Hey! this is a simple game based on the classic Hangman - where instead of the hangman, your 💗s are at stake.
It's built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project was created from scratch as a learning experience and I had a lot of fun making it (_totally never had the urge to scream my lungs out_ 🫣)

Here's a brief of my project - I hope you like it <3

## 💡 Key Learnings

This project taught me **A LOT** including:

- **Tailwind CSS**: My first time using this framework! I added custom colors, fonts and learnt how utility classes work.
- **Core JS concepts**: Improved my understanding of eventlisteners, async await, do...while loop, and DOM Manipulatiom.
- **Debugging Skills**: Faced and fixed many frustrating bugs, which helped me be more patient.
- **Responsiveness Challenges**: Making the game responsive was **FAR trickier** than I expected!
